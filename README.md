# UnifiedWaveSimulator

Welcome to the Unified Wave Simulator, a project exploring the universe as a network of wave spheres based on the Unified Wave Theory. This repository serves as the parent hub for 10 modular simulations, each modeling a unique phenomenon (e.g., wave spheres, electric current, fusion). 

## Vision
- Matter as wave interactions, not just particles.
- A cosmic simulator to test and expand the theory.
- Open to collaboration—join the #TWINR movement!

## Modules
- [WaveSpheres](link) - Simulates base wave spheres.
- [ElectricCurrent](link) - Models current flow.
- [Fusion](link) - Explores melting points.
- ... (9 more to come)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo.
2. Check individual module repos for code.
3. Contribute or simulate with us!
